//! Build-configuration e2e test for [DIST-CI-DOTNET-DEPSFILE] (GitHub issue #111).
//!
//! `SharpLsp.Sidecar.Common` is a *referenced-only* class library: it is consumed
//! by the executable sidecars (`SharpLsp.Sidecar.CSharp`) and the test project,
//! each of which generates its own `deps.json`. Common's own `deps.json` is never
//! read at runtime — it exists only to be written into `bin/` on every build,
//! where a concurrent/indexing process can momentarily hold it open and make the
//! `GenerateDepsFile` `MSBuild` task fail with:
//!
//!   error MSB4018: The "`GenerateDepsFile`" task failed unexpectedly.
//!   System.IO.IOException: The process cannot access the file
//!   'SharpLsp.Sidecar.Common.deps.json' because it is being used by another process.
//!
//! The fix is to stop emitting that unnecessary, lock-prone artifact for the
//! library: `<GenerateDependencyFile>false</GenerateDependencyFile>`. This test
//! asserts — via a real `MSBuild` evaluation of the real `.csproj`, not string
//! matching — that dependency-file generation is disabled for Common.
//!
//! See `docs/bugs/BUILD-GENERATEDEPSFILE-LOCK-BUG.md`.
