## Profiler

SharpLsp wraps `dotnet-trace`, `dotnet-counters`, and `dotnet-dump` into a seamless editor experience. No terminal required.

### Setup

Install the .NET diagnostic tools:

```bash
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-trace
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-counters
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-dump
```

### Usage

Open the **Profiler** panel in the SharpLsp sidebar to see running .NET processes.

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Trace performance** | `SharpLsp: Start Trace` — select a process, trace runs until you stop it. Output opens in SpeedScope. |
| **Monitor counters** | `SharpLsp: Start Counters` — live-updating table of .NET performance counters in a webview panel. |
| **Capture memory dump** | `SharpLsp: Collect Dump` — choose Heap, Full, or Mini dump type. |
| **Analyze heap** | `SharpLsp: Analyze Heap` — select a `.dmp` file to see type counts and memory usage. |

All commands are available from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
