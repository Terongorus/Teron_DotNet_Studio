///   * [ANALYZERS-DEADCODE-SEVERITY] — monorepo-wide dead-code detection. A symbol whose
///     only use is its own definition is dead. When the workspace is declared a
///     **monorepo** (`[analyzers] monorepo = true` in `sharplsp.toml`), the whole
///     repository is the world, so an unused *public* symbol is genuinely dead and
///     is reported as an **error**. Outside monorepo mode, public symbols are
///     assumed to be an external API and only private/internal dead code is
///     surfaced (as a warning). FSAC's unused-symbol detection is file-local and
///     never errors — this is project-wide and gate-able.
///
/// Diagnostics reuse the [DiagnosticResult] wire shape so the
/// `workspace/diagnostics` handler can merge analyzer output with the compiler
/// diagnostics with zero conversion.
