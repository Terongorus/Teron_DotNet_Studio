## Summary

| Priority | Feature Count | Weeks | Impact |
|----------|--------------|-------|--------|
| P1 - Critical | 6 tracks — **4 DONE**, 1 partial, 1 missing | 1-6 | Code actions, semantic tokens, inlay hints, formatting shipped; rename still missing |
| P2 - Essential | 4 tracks, ~35 items | 7-14 | Makes SharpLsp viable for daily use |
| P3 - Quality of Life | 5 tracks — **2 DONE**, 3 remaining | 15-20 | Workspace symbols + code lens shipped |
| P4 - Surpass | 6 tracks — **2 DONE**, 4 remaining | 21+ | Call hierarchy + type hierarchy shipped |

**Remaining gaps: ~40 items across P1-P4.**

The biggest remaining gaps are **rename** (P0 parity blocker), **debugging** (P2.1), and **test explorer** (P2.2). P2 remains the next broad feature area, but rename is the critical refactoring gap inside P1.

### What SharpLsp Already Does Better

Even today, SharpLsp goes beyond C# Dev Kit on:
1. **F# support** -- Dev Kit has literally zero
2. **Solution Explorer depth** -- members, namespaces, sort modes
3. **Profiler** -- full EventPipe/counter/heap integration
4. **Dependency management** -- remove packages/refs from context menu
5. **Call hierarchy + type hierarchy** -- Dev Kit has neither
6. **Open source** -- no license, no sign-in, no vendor lock-in
7. **Editor-agnostic** -- works in Zed and Rider too, not just VS Code
