# Go to Definition Implementation Plan

**Spec:** [DEFINITION-SPEC.md](../specs/DEFINITION-SPEC.md)

## Context

Implements `textDocument/definition`, `textDocument/typeDefinition`, `textDocument/declaration`, and `textDocument/implementation` for C# (Roslyn) and F# (FCS). The Rust host routes requests to the appropriate sidecar, which resolves the symbol and returns one or more source locations. All four methods are P0 features targeting Phase 2.

All four C# navigation methods are implemented end-to-end: the Rust host registers all four capabilities, routes requests to the C# sidecar via MessagePack IPC, and the sidecar resolves symbols via Roslyn's `SemanticModel`, `GetSymbolInfo`, `GetTypeInfo`, and `SymbolFinder.FindImplementationsAsync`. Tree-sitter pre-validation short-circuits requests on comments, string literals, and whitespace. Multi-location responses work for both `textDocument/definition` (partial classes) and `textDocument/implementation`. The `DefinitionResolver` (in `DefinitionResolver.cs`) supports `CandidateSymbols` fallback, `GetDeclaredSymbol` fallback for cursors on declarations, override-to-base navigation, interface impl-to-interface member navigation, and partial method definition parts.

**Interim nonconformant memoizer** (`nav_cache.rs`): the current `HashMap` retains definition/typeDefinition/declaration results by `(uri, version, line, character, method)` and drops entries on `didChange`/`didClose`. It is not salsa, does not model solution or sidecar-generation inputs, and invalidation does not cancel in-flight requests. [DEFINITION-CACHE] remains the required design.

**LocationResult** includes end positions (`EndLine`, `EndCharacter`) enabling proper range highlighting in peek preview.

**Test status**: 18+ E2E tests pass (6 syntax-only + 6 full-stack definition + 6 full-stack nav). Full-stack tests verify end-to-end through real Roslyn sidecar with `dotnet restore` workspaces. Constructor definition, `var` type definition, and interleaved nav methods all tested.

The remaining work covers F# sidecar navigation, metadata/decompiled source navigation, cross-language navigation, and performance benchmarking. Roslyn natively handles `nameof()`, `using` aliases, constructor references, `var` inference, lambda parameter types, and tuple element types through the existing `GetSymbolInfo`/`GetTypeInfo` pipeline.

## TODO

### Rust Host

- [x] Add `textDocument/definition` handler registration in LSP server capabilities
- [x] Implement request routing: identify language from VFS, dispatch to correct sidecar
- [x] Add `textDocument/typeDefinition` handler registration and routing
- [x] Add `textDocument/declaration` handler registration and routing
- [x] Add `textDocument/implementation` handler registration and routing
- [x] Support multi-location responses (`Location[]`) for partial classes and implementations

- [ ] Replace `nav_cache.rs` with Rust-host salsa queries keyed by document/version/position/method plus solution and sidecar-generation inputs
- [ ] Implement cancellation for superseded requests; `didChange`/`didClose` invalidation currently prevents only later reuse
- [x] Add fallback behavior: return `null` when sidecar is unavailable or loading

### F# Sidecar (FCS) — textDocument/definition

- [x] Implement definition handler: `FSharpCheckFileResults.GetDeclarationLocation()` pipeline — `FSharpWorkspace.fs:getDefinition`
- [x] Handle `FindDeclResult.DeclFound` (return location) — `extractDefinition` maps range to `DefinitionLocation`
- [x] Handle `FindDeclResult.DeclNotFound` (return null) — returns `None`
- [x] Handle `FindDeclResult.ExternalDecl` (metadata — return null in Phase 2) — returns `None`
- [x] Handle discriminated union case navigation — FCS `GetDeclarationLocation` resolves DU cases natively
- [x] Handle record field navigation — FCS `GetDeclarationLocation` resolves record fields natively
- [x] Handle active pattern navigation — FCS `GetDeclarationLocation` resolves active patterns natively
- [x] Handle computation expression keyword navigation (`let!`, `do!`, `return!`) — FCS resolves CE keywords to builder methods
- [x] Handle module function navigation — FCS `GetDeclarationLocation` resolves module functions natively

### F# Sidecar (FCS) — textDocument/typeDefinition

- [x] Implement type definition handler via `GetSymbolUseAtLocation()` — `extractTypeDefinition` in `FSharpWorkspace.fs`
- [x] Extract type from `FSharpMemberOrFunctionOrValue.FullType` — `getTypeEntity` helper
- [x] Extract type from `FSharpField.FieldType` — `getTypeEntity` helper
- [x] Navigate to type's declaration range — `rangeToLocation` converts FCS Range to 0-based

### F# Sidecar (FCS) — textDocument/declaration

- [x] Implement declaration handler (same as definition for most F# symbols) — `extractDeclaration` in `FSharpWorkspace.fs`
- [x] Navigate to interface member for interface implementations — `findBaseMember` searches interface hierarchies

### F# Sidecar (FCS) — textDocument/implementation

- [x] Implement implementation handler — `extractImplementations` in `FSharpWorkspace.fs`
- [x] Return symbol's own declaration location — matches FsAutoComplete behavior (FCS lacks direct FindImplementations)
- [x] Return `LocationListResult` for all implementations

### C# Sidecar (Roslyn) — textDocument/definition

- [x] Implement definition handler: `Document` → `SemanticModel` → `GetSymbolInfo()` pipeline
- [x] Add fallback to `CandidateSymbols` when `Symbol` is null
- [x] Extract source location from `ISymbol.Locations` where `IsInSource`
- [x] Support multiple `Location` results for partial classes/methods — `ResolveDefinitionLocationsAsync` returns `LocationListResult` with all `IsInSource` locations
- [x] Handle `nameof()` expressions (navigate to referenced symbol) — Roslyn's `GetSymbolInfo` resolves nameof arguments natively
- [x] Handle `using` aliases (navigate to aliased type) — Roslyn's `GetSymbolInfo` resolves through aliases natively
- [x] Handle constructor references (navigate to constructor declaration) — Roslyn's `GetSymbolInfo` resolves `new T()` to the type; E2E test `test_full_stack_definition_on_constructor` verifies
- [x] Handle implicit declarations and generated source (source generators) — `FindDocumentAsync` searches source-generated documents via `GetSourceGeneratedDocumentsAsync`; Roslyn sets `IsInSource = true` for generated symbols

### C# Sidecar (Roslyn) — textDocument/typeDefinition

- [x] Implement type definition handler: `SemanticModel.GetTypeInfo()` pipeline
- [x] Use `TypeInfo.Type` with fallback to `TypeInfo.ConvertedType`
- [x] Navigate to the type symbol's source `Locations`
- [x] Handle `var` (navigate to inferred type) — Roslyn's `GetTypeInfo` resolves inferred types natively; E2E test `test_full_stack_type_definition_on_variable` verifies `var dog` → `Dog`
- [x] Handle lambda parameters (navigate to inferred parameter type) — Roslyn's `GetTypeInfo` resolves lambda parameter types natively
- [x] Handle tuple elements (navigate to element type) — Roslyn's `GetTypeInfo` resolves tuple element types natively

### C# Sidecar (Roslyn) — textDocument/declaration

- [x] Implement declaration handler
- [x] Navigate to interface member for interface implementations (`INamedTypeSymbol.Interfaces`)
- [x] Navigate to base virtual/abstract member for overrides (`OverriddenMethod`/`OverriddenProperty`)
- [x] Navigate to defining partial part (`PartialDefinitionPart`)

### C# Sidecar (Roslyn) — textDocument/implementation

- [x] Implement implementation handler via `SymbolFinder.FindImplementationsAsync()`
- [x] Return `LocationListResult` with all concrete implementations
- [x] Support interface → all implementing classes
- [x] Support abstract/virtual method → all overrides

### C# Sidecar (Roslyn) — Metadata Navigation

- [x] Integrate ICSharpCode.Decompiler v9.1.0 for metadata symbol navigation — `MetadataNavigator.cs`
- [x] Decompile containing type to temporary file on definition request — writes to `{tempdir}/sharplsp-decompiled/{type}.cs`
- [x] Add interim decompiled-source reuse keyed by `(assemblyPath, typeFullName)` in `ConcurrentDictionary` (nonconformant)
- [ ] Move decompiled-source memoization to the Rust-host salsa database and remove the sidecar `ConcurrentDictionary`
- [x] Fallback in `DefinitionResolver`: when `ToAllSourceLocations` returns empty, calls `MetadataNavigator.ResolveMetadataSymbol`
- [x] Symbol position search in decompiled source using kind-specific patterns (method, property, field, type)

### Cross-Language Navigation

Implemented via **metadata-as-source**: each engine wires the *other* language's
referenced project output DLL into its own compilation and decompiles the target
type, so navigation crosses the boundary without a cross-sidecar symbol index.
See `[DEFINITION-CROSSLANG]`.

- [x] Design cross-sidecar fallback routing in Rust host — `pick_sidecar_with_fallback` returns `(primary, fallback)`
- [x] `is_empty_nav_result` detects null/empty responses to trigger cross-language fallback
- [x] Shared `<ProjectReference>` resolver in Common — `ProjectReferences.ReadReferencedProjects` / `FindOutputAssembly`
- [x] Shared metadata-as-source decompiler in Common — `MetadataDecompiler` (used by both sidecars; C# `MetadataNavigator` delegates to it)
- [x] C# → F#: re-attach the dropped F# `<ProjectReference>` output DLL as a metadata reference and drop the empty stub project — `WorkspaceManager.AddCrossLanguageMetadataReferences`
- [x] F# → C#: wire referenced C# project output DLLs into FCS options (`buildProjectOptions`) + `FSharpMetadataNavigator` decompiles external symbols in `extractDefinition`
- [x] E2E test: cross-language navigation on a mixed C#/F# solution — `test_cross_language_definition_csharp_to_fsharp`, `test_cross_language_definition_fsharp_to_csharp` (`src/sharplsp/tests/e2e_modules/definition_cross_language.rs`)
- [ ] Source-to-source cross-language navigation (land in the original `.fs`/`.cs` rather than decompiled metadata) — needs a cross-sidecar symbol index (P2, Phase 4)
