# DIAGNOSTICS-PLAN

Implementation plan for [DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md).

> **Architecture pivot (current).** The previous push-based, eager-solution-scan plan produced phantom CS0246/CS0234 errors during workspace load and could not be repaired by the verification pass. The plan now mirrors `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer` (the engine behind C# Dev Kit): NuGet restore gate → workspace open → pull-driven diagnostics with `global_state_version`-keyed `resultId` → debounced `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`. See [DIAG-ARCHITECTURE-PULL-REFRESH](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md). Phases 1–2 below are partially completed; the parts that still apply are kept, the parts that contradict the new architecture are marked obsolete with rationale.

## Phase 1: Per-Document Diagnostics IPC (P0) — DONE

The sidecar's per-document diagnostics path is correct and survives the pivot. The Rust host's push wiring stays as the LSP-3.16 fallback for editors that don't negotiate pull.

### Rust LSP Host

- [x] Create `diagnostics` module in Rust host (`src/sharplsp/src/diagnostics.rs`)
- [x] Map sidecar `DiagnosticResult` → LSP `Diagnostic` struct
  - Map severity: `"Error"` → 1, `"Warning"` → 2, `"Info"` → 3, `"Hidden"` → 4
  - Map code, message, range
  - Set `source: "sharplsp-csharp"`
- [x] On `textDocument/didOpen` / `textDocument/didChange` / `textDocument/didSave`: request diagnostics from sidecar (background task) — kept as the push fallback path
- [x] Send `textDocument/publishDiagnostics` notification with mapped results — push fallback only; pull is primary (Phase 5)
- [x] Clear diagnostics on `textDocument/didClose`
- [x] Version-gate the push pipeline ([DIAG-PUSH-GATE](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md)): per-URI push generations, stale results never published, failed fetch for the newest generation retried until published or superseded. Hardening found while investigating GitHub #160 — that issue's actual root cause was path-qualified `_._` placeholder references poisoning FCS ([PKG-ASSETS-FS](../specs/PACKAGE-MAINTENANCE-SPEC.md)), fixed in `FSharpAssets.packageAssemblies` with regression test `path-qualified placeholder compile entries are never handed to FCS as references`. Rust test: `failed_fetch_after_revert_must_not_strand_stale_published_diagnostics`; F# sidecar guard: `diagnostics clear after an error edit is reverted`
- [ ] Add debounce (150ms window) before sidecar push request — superseded by Phase 5's 2000ms refresh debounce; only relevant if push fallback is in use
- [x] Rust e2e tests: `test_diagnostics_cleared_on_close`, `test_request_works_after_diagnostic_notification`
- [x] VSCode extension tests: `diagnostics.test.ts` (6 tests — error detection, missing type, clean file, edit cycle, range check, close clears)
- [ ] Full-stack test: open a file with real errors → errors appear in Problems panel (requires sidecar)

### C# Sidecar

- [x] `workspace/diagnostics` handler exists (`CSharpSidecar.HandleDiagnosticsAsync`) — extended in Phase 5 to accept `previousResultId` and emit `Changed` flag
- [x] `WorkspaceManager.GetDiagnosticsAsync` extracts from `SemanticModel.GetDiagnostics()`
- [x] `DiagnosticResult` MessagePack type defined

## Phase 2: Solution-Wide Eager Scan (P0) — REMOVED

> ⚠️ **Removed by architecture pivot.** This phase implemented the eager `workspace/diagnostics/all` bulk RPC and the post-load solution scan. The eager scan iterates `Solution.Projects` and calls `GetCompilationAsync()` on each, which produces phantom CS0246/CS0234 because consumer projects are compiled before their dependencies are cached as `CompilationReference`s. The replacement is Phase 5 (pull-driven workspace diagnostics) plus Phase 5.6 (NuGet restore gate). See [DIAG-ARCHITECTURE-EAGER-SCAN](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md).

### Rust LSP Host

- [x] Read `diagnostics.solution_wide_analysis` from config (default: `true`) — kept; now controls whether the server answers `workspace/diagnostic` pulls
- [x] Read `diagnostics.project_filter` from config (default: empty = all projects) — kept; now restricts `workspace/diagnostic` results
- [x] On solution load: request solution-wide diagnostics — ⚠️ **OBSOLETE.** Removed. The host no longer triggers a scan on load; the editor pulls when it wants data. `request_solution_in_background` in `src/sharplsp/src/diagnostics.rs` will be deleted in Phase 5.
- [x] Stream diagnostics incrementally (batch by file) to avoid blocking — ⚠️ **OBSOLETE.** Replaced by `workspace/diagnostic` partial-result streaming in Phase 5.
- [ ] On file change: re-request diagnostics for changed file + dependents — ⚠️ **OBSOLETE.** Replaced by `diagnostics/refresh` IPC + debounced `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` in Phase 5.
- [x] Advertise `workspaceDiagnostics: true` in server capabilities — kept; required for pull workspace diagnostics

### C# Sidecar

- [x] Add `workspace/diagnostics/all` IPC handler — ⚠️ **TO BE DELETED in Phase 5.** Caused phantom CS0246s on workspace load.
- [x] Add `GetAllDiagnosticsAsync(string[]? projectFilter, CancellationToken)` to `WorkspaceManager` — ⚠️ **TO BE DELETED in Phase 5.** Same reason.
  - The topological-order patch landed on `OrderProjectsByDependencies` (`WorkspaceManager.cs`) was a partial mitigation. It does not survive: source generators and NuGet still race even with topological iteration. The function is removed entirely.
- [ ] Stream results — send partial diagnostics as each project completes — **moved to Phase 5** as part of `workspace/diagnostic` partial-result streaming.

### Configuration

- [x] `DiagnosticsConfig.solution_wide_analysis` field exists (default: `true`)
- [x] `DiagnosticsConfig.analyzers_enabled` field exists (default: `true`)
- [x] Add `project_filter: Vec<String>` to `DiagnosticsConfig`
- [ ] Add `min_severity: String` to `DiagnosticsConfig` (default: `"hint"`)
- [ ] Add `max_per_file: u32` to `DiagnosticsConfig` (default: `0` = unlimited)
- [ ] Hot-reload config via `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`

## Phase 3: F# Diagnostics (P0 — parallel with C#)

- [ ] `FSharpCheckFileResults.Diagnostics` integration in F# sidecar
- [ ] Map F# diagnostic severity to LSP
- [ ] Solution-wide F# analysis via `FSharpChecker`
- [ ] FSharpLint integration for code style
- [ ] FSharp.Analyzers.SDK plugin loading

## Phase 4: Analyzer Diagnostics (P0)

- [ ] Enable Roslyn `DiagnosticAnalyzer` framework in sidecar
  - `CompilationWithAnalyzers.GetAnalyzerDiagnosticsAsync()`
- [ ] Load analyzers from project NuGet references
- [ ] Load .editorconfig severity overrides
- [ ] IDE0005 (unused usings) detection
- [ ] Map analyzer diagnostic codes to LSP `Diagnostic.code` + `codeDescription` URL

SharpLsp-owned static analyzers are tracked in
[DIAGNOSTICS-STATIC-ANALYZERS-PLAN.md](DIAGNOSTICS-STATIC-ANALYZERS-PLAN.md).
The first rules are monorepo-gated, solution-wide unused-public-code analyzers
for both C# and F#.

## Phase 5: Pull Diagnostics + Refresh Cycle (P0 — primary path)

This is now the **primary** diagnostic pipeline. Pull is mandatory for editors that advertise `textDocument.diagnostic` client capability; push (Phase 1 wiring) is fallback only. Implements [DIAG-ARCHITECTURE-PULL-REFRESH](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md), [DIAG-LSP-PULL](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md), and [DIAG-LSP-REFRESH](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md).

### Rust LSP Host

- [x] Implement `textDocument/diagnostic` request handler (LSP 3.17 pull model) — `pull_diagnostics.rs`
- [x] Implement `workspace/diagnostic` request handler — `pull_diagnostics.rs`
- [ ] Forward `previousResultId` to sidecar in IPC payload
- [ ] Return `RelatedFullDocumentDiagnosticReport` when changed, `RelatedUnchangedDocumentDiagnosticReport` (`{ kind: "unchanged" }`) when sidecar reports `Changed = false`
- [ ] Construct `resultId = "p:{project_version}|d:{doc_version}|g:{global_state_version}"` from sidecar response fields
- [ ] `workspace/diagnostic` partial-result streaming via `WorkDoneProgress` partialResultToken — emit one `WorkspaceDocumentDiagnosticReport` per project as it completes
- [ ] Subscribe to the [DIAG-IPC-REFRESH](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md) sidecar notification
- [ ] Implement debounced refresh queue: `tokio::sync::Notify` + 2000ms `tokio::time::sleep` collapse, matches `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer`'s `AsyncBatchingWorkQueue`
- [ ] Send LSP `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` notification when the debounce drains
- [ ] **Delete** `request_solution_in_background` from `src/sharplsp/src/diagnostics.rs` (the eager-scan trigger)
- [ ] **Delete** `verify_error_files`, `sync_text_to_sidecar` from `src/sharplsp/src/diagnostics.rs` (verification pass — see Phase 5.5)
- [ ] Cancel in-flight per-document IPC pulls when editor sends a fresh pull for the same document
- [ ] Server capability: add `diagnosticProvider.identifier = "sharplsp"` so editors distinguish SharpLsp's diagnostics

### C# Sidecar

- [ ] Extend `workspace/diagnostics` IPC payload to `DiagnosticsRequest { FilePath, PreviousResultId? }`
- [ ] Extend response to include `ResultId` and `Changed` flag; return empty items when `Changed = false`
- [ ] Add `workspace/diagnostics/pull` IPC handler — streams per-document `WorkspaceDocumentDiagnosticReport`s via partial responses (replaces the deleted `workspace/diagnostics/all`)
- [ ] Add `WorkspaceDiagnosticsCache` keyed by `(DocumentId, ProjectVersion, DocumentVersion, GlobalStateVersion)` — mirrors Roslyn's `VersionedPullCache`
- [ ] Add `IDiagnosticsRefresher` equivalent: `GlobalStateVersion: ulong` field + `RefreshRequested` event
- [ ] Subscribe to `_workspace.RegisterWorkspaceChangedHandler` — on `ProjectAdded`, `ProjectReloaded`, `ProjectRemoved`, `SolutionAdded`, `SolutionChanged`, `SolutionReloaded`, `DocumentChanged`, increment `GlobalStateVersion` and fire `RefreshRequested`
- [ ] Add `diagnostics/refresh` outbound IPC notification (sidecar → host) carrying `{ GlobalStateVersion, AffectedProjectIds[] }`
- [ ] Add `workspace/initializationComplete` outbound IPC notification fired once after restore + `OpenSolutionAsync` complete
- [ ] **Delete** `GetAllDiagnosticsAsync` from `WorkspaceManager`
- [ ] **Delete** `OrderProjectsByDependencies` (added as a partial mitigation; obsolete now that the eager scan is gone)
- [ ] **Delete** `workspace/diagnostics/all` handler from `CSharpSidecar`
- [ ] Skip auto-generated syntax trees (`syntaxTree.IsAutoGenerated`, `GeneratedKind.MarkedGenerated`) — matches OmniSharp's behavior; prevents diagnostics on `obj/Debug/.../*.AssemblyInfo.cs` etc.

### Tests

- [ ] Full-stack: pull diagnostics during workspace load returns "loading" or partial results, never CS0246 for resolvable types
- [ ] Full-stack: `previousResultId` round-trip — repeat pull returns `{ kind: "unchanged" }`
- [ ] Full-stack: workspace mutation triggers `workspace/diagnostic/refresh` within 2.5s (debounce + slack)
- [ ] Full-stack: editing a file invalidates only its project's `resultId`s; unrelated files' pulls return unchanged
- [ ] Full-stack: 8-project diamond graph (the current `test_full_stack_cross_project_references_no_false_positives` fixture) — pull never returns phantom CS0246

## Phase 5.5: Diagnostic Verification (P0) — REMOVED

> ⚠️ **Removed by architecture pivot.** The verification pass re-sent `textDocument/didChange` with the same disk text and re-fetched diagnostics, expecting Roslyn to clear false positives. It does not work — `Solution.WithDocumentText` does not re-resolve metadata references or re-run source generators, so the same phantom errors come back. The pull + refresh model in Phase 5 removes the pass's reason to exist: SharpLsp no longer asserts diagnostics until the editor pulls. See [DIAG-ARCHITECTURE-EAGER-SCAN](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md).

Original tasks (kept here for traceability — every item is undone in Phase 5):

- [x] `didOpen` syncs document text to sidecar via `notify_did_change` — kept (it's a correct text-sync operation, just no longer part of a verification pipeline)
- [x] After solution-wide scan, verification pass re-checks files with errors/warnings — ⚠️ **DELETED** (`verify_error_files` removed in Phase 5)
- [x] Verification publishes corrected diagnostics per-file (clears false positives) — ⚠️ **DELETED** (no push during load)
- [x] Verification yields between files to avoid starving other sidecar requests — ⚠️ **DELETED**
- [x] Test: `test_full_stack_diagnostics_cleared_after_error_fixed` (deterministic) — kept; now exercises pull semantics (close → fixed file → pull returns clean)
- [ ] Exponential backoff for persistent errors (1s, 2s, 4s, max 30s) — ⚠️ **NOT NEEDED.** Pulls run only when the editor asks; there is no retry loop to back off.
- [ ] Periodic re-verification for long-running sessions — ⚠️ **NOT NEEDED.** Workspace events drive `diagnostics/refresh`; the editor re-pulls on its own schedule.

## Phase 5.6: NuGet Restore Gate (P0)

The single biggest source of phantom CS0246 is unresolved NuGet `<PackageReference>` items at workspace open. Mirrors `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.LanguageServer.HostWorkspace.ProjectDependencyHelper`. Implements [DIAG-RESTORE](../specs/DIAGNOSTICS-SPEC.md).

### C# Sidecar

- [ ] Add `Workspace/ProjectRestorer.cs`: inspect each project's `obj/project.assets.json`, compare timestamp + `PackageReference` set against `.csproj`
- [ ] Add `Workspace/DotnetCliHelper.cs`: shell `dotnet restore <path> --verbosity quiet`, capture stdout/stderr, surface failures as a structured error
- [ ] In `WorkspaceManager.OpenCoreAsync`: call `ProjectRestorer.RestoreIfStaleAsync(target, ct)` BEFORE `MSBuildWorkspace.Create(...)`
- [ ] Honor `diagnostics.auto_restore_on_open` config flag (default true) — when false, skip restore and surface a server-side warning notification
- [ ] After restore completes successfully, increment `GlobalStateVersion` and fire `diagnostics/refresh`
- [ ] After restore + `OpenSolutionAsync` complete, fire `workspace/initializationComplete` outbound IPC notification

### Rust LSP Host

- [ ] On workspace open: create LSP `$/progress` work-done token (`workspace/sharplsp-load`)
- [ ] Forward sidecar restore progress (start, per-project status, end) via `$/progress` notifications
- [ ] On `workspace/initializationComplete` from sidecar: send LSP `workspace/projectInitializationComplete` (custom notification, matches Roslyn LSP contract); end the work-done progress
- [ ] Add `diagnostics.auto_restore_on_open` to `DiagnosticsConfig` (default true)

### Tests

- [ ] Full-stack: workspace with stale `assets.json` (delete it) → server triggers restore on open, no CS0246 for NuGet types after init complete
- [ ] Full-stack: workspace with `diagnostics.auto_restore_on_open = false` → server publishes a warning, leaves diagnostics in incomplete state, does not lie about success
- [ ] Full-stack: `workspace/projectInitializationComplete` notification fires exactly once per workspace open

## Phase 6: Background Analysis Optimization (P1)

- [ ] Cache `Project.GetCompilationAsync` results across pulls within the same `Solution` snapshot (Roslyn does this internally — verify our IPC layer doesn't defeat it)
- [ ] Cancel stale per-document IPC pulls on new pulls for the same document
- [ ] Memory budget: cap `WorkspaceDiagnosticsCache` size; LRU-evict by `GlobalStateVersion` age
- [ ] Progress reporting via `$/progress` for `workspace/diagnostic` pulls (in addition to load progress from Phase 5.6)
