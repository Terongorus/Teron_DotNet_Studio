SharpLsp is building the .NET development stack that should already exist: Visual Studio/Rider-grade language intelligence, solution awareness, diagnostics, refactoring, package management, debugging, and profiling without forcing every developer into the same IDE.

## Why This Exists

.NET tooling is powerful, but the experience is fragmented:

- **Visual Studio** still sets the benchmark for .NET tooling, but it is Windows-only.
- **C# Dev Kit** is tied to VS Code, carries enterprise licensing constraints, and does not replace Visual Studio's profiler or performance tooling.
- **Rider** is excellent, but its .NET intelligence lives inside Rider and cannot be reused by the rest of your team's editors.
- **F#** too often trails behind C# instead of receiving equal first-class tooling.
- **Neovim, Zed, Helix, Emacs, and other editors** are left stitching together partial community workflows.

SharpLsp treats language tooling as infrastructure. The editor should be a preference, not the place where the .NET language engine is trapped.

## Architecture

SharpLsp is split into three parts:

- **Rust host**: owns editor communication, request routing, virtual files, tree-sitter syntax work, and sidecar lifecycle.
- **C# sidecar**: hosts Roslyn for semantic C# features.
- **F# sidecar**: hosts FSharp.Compiler.Service for semantic F# features.

That split keeps the editor protocol fast and portable while letting the .NET compilers do the semantic work they are built for.

## Install

### VS Code

Install the SharpLsp extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nimblesite.sharplsp). The extension ships with the SharpLsp engine and both sidecars — no Rust toolchain or separate install required.

### Other editors

Rider, Zed, Neovim, Helix, and Emacs support is coming soon.

## Documentation
